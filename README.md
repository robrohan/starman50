# Starman 2050

For my final cs50 project, I am making a rather silly game with Lua and Love. The premise is as follow:

> You are Starman. 
>
> Launched by SpaceX in 2018, you have been under cryogenic stasis until today. You are a top secret agent armed only with your Tesla Roadster. You need to destroy an AI based civilization called _The Gates_. _The Gates_ are on a collision course with Earth. If you fail, Elon Musk will be annoyed.
