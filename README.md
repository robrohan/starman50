# Starman 2050

For my final cs50 project, I am making a rather silly game with Lua and Love. The premise is as follow:

> You are Starman. 
>
> Launched by SpaceX in 2018, you have been under cryogenic stasis until today. You are a top secret agent armed only with your Tesla Roadster. You need to destroy an AI based civilization that is on a collision course with Earth. If you fail, Elon will be annoyed.

## Assets

Game assets that should be distributed with the game.

## Design

Place to keep in progress art files (PSDs for example). Shouldn't be distributed with the game.
