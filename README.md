# Starman 2050

For my final cs50 project, I am making a rather silly game with Lua and Love. The premise is as follow:

> You are Starman. 
>
> Launched by SpaceX in 2018, you have been under cryogenic stasis until today. You are a top secret agent armed only with your Tesla Roadster. You need to destroy an AI based civilization called _The Gates_. _The Gates_ are on a collision course with Earth. If you fail, Elon Musk will be annoyed.

If you'd like to play it, but don't want to checkout the code, you can grab a copy from [itch.io](https://therohans.itch.io/starman-2050) if you are on Windows.

## Credits

* Since this was for [CS50 class](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science), a lot of the code was based on bits from that class.

* While I didn't use very much of it, I got some of the camera code from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AayjEF3dqa8)

* The sine wave shader for the laser I made from playing around with stuff from
[The book of shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/05/)

* While the pixel art is terrible, anything good from it is because of [videos made by AdamCYounis](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC08QfQDLAd9D7aYPFgBUIng) videos.

## Building

See the Love2d website for how to setup love2d. Once that is up and running you should be able to just run `love .` from within the project's main directory.

## Design Folder

Place to keep in progress art files (aseprite and Muse score files for example). These files shouldn't be distributed with the game.

## Assets

Game assets that should be distributed with the game.
